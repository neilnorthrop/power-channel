Perfect — here’s a Tier 0 Tool Crafting Recipe Tree Chart that captures all the logic we just laid out. I’ll keep it structured like a design doc so you can drop this straight into your notes or a game design wiki.

🛠️ Tier 0 Tool Crafting Recipe Tree

Crafting Grammar
Handle + Working End + Binding = Tool
* Handles: Stick, Branch, Bone
* Working Ends: Shaped Stone, Flint, Bone Tip
* Binding: Twine (made from fibers/grass/reeds)

Tool Recipes
🔪 Stone Knife
* Handle: 1 Stick
* Working End: 1 Shaped Stone (made by Loose Stone + Flint)
* Binding: 1 Twine👉 Result: Stone Knife (cuts fibers, butchering, small tasks)

🪓 Stone Axe
* Handle: 1 Branch
* Working End: 1 Shaped Stone Head (Loose Stone + Flint)
* Binding: 2 Twine (extra strength)👉 Result: Stone Axe (chops trees, progression unlock to Tier 1 logs)

⛏️ Stone Pickaxe
* Handle: 1 Branch
* Working End: 2 Shaped Stone Heads (joined as a pick head)
* Binding: 2 Twine👉 Result: Stone Pickaxe (breaks stone, ores, unlocks Tier 1 minerals)

🗡️ Stone Spear
* Handle: 1 Branch or 1 Bone (shaft)
* Working End: 1 Flint or Bone Tip (sharpened)
* Binding: 1 Twine👉 Result: Stone Spear (hunting, defense)

🪵 Club
* Handle + Working End Combined: 1 Branch or 1 Bone
* Binding: None required👉 Result: Club (crude blunt weapon, lowest durability)

🔥 Torch
* Handle: 1 Stick
* Working End: 1 Grass/Fiber (kindling)
* Optional Additive: Resin (longer burn time, if available later)
* Binding: None required (fiber wraps directly)👉 Result: Torch (light source, fire spread mechanic)

Supporting Crafting Chains
* Twine: 3 Fibers/Grass/Reeds → 1 Twine (universal binding).
* Shaped Stone Head: Loose Stone + Flint → Shaped Stone Head (basic crafting step).
* Bone Tip: Bone (knapped/ground) → Bone Tip (spear alternative).

🌐 Flow of Progression
1. Stick + Flint + Twine → Knife
2. Knife cuts more Fibers → More Twine
3. Branch + Shaped Stone Head + Twine → Axe
4. Axe unlocks Tier 1 Logs → Push to next tier
👉 Players can see logs in the world but need the Axe → strong motivation to progress.

⚖️ Design Benefits
* Each tool feels like it has physical logic (player can “see” the recipe).
* Recipes use quantities sensibly: bigger tools = more twine & stronger handles.
* Substitution system (bone for wood, flint for stone) makes recipes flexible, not frustrating.
* Natural progression loop: Twine and Flint are the early bottlenecks → players learn resource flow.


[World Resources]
   |
   |-- Wood
   |     |-- Stick  → Used directly as handles
   |     |-- Branch → Breaks down into multiple sticks OR used whole as crude handle
   |
   |-- Stone
   |     |-- Loose Stone → Can be shaped (with Flint) into Stone Head
   |     |-- Flint       → Used to shape Loose Stones into sharper heads
   |
   |-- Fibers
   |     |-- Plant Fibers / Grass / Reeds → Twisted into Twine (universal binding)
   |
   |-- Animal Byproducts
         |-- Bones → Used as alternative handles or crude working ends
         |-- (Optional Hides for future tiers)

[Twine Creation]
   Fibers/Grass/Reeds (x3)
         ↓
        Twine


[Tool Heads]
   Loose Stone + Flint → Shaped Stone Head
   Bone (processed)    → Bone Tip


[Tool Assembly]
   Knife: Stick + Shaped Stone Head + Twine
   Axe: Branch + Shaped Stone Head + 2 Twine
   Pickaxe: Branch + 2 Shaped Stone Heads + 2 Twine
   Spear: Branch/Bone + Flint/Bone Tip + Twine
   Club: Branch or Bone (no binding)
   Torch: Stick + Fiber/Grass


Step 1: Gather sticks, stones, grass, branches
   ↓
Step 2: Use Flint to shape stone → unlocks tool heads
   ↓
Step 3: Craft Knife → enables faster fiber harvesting (more twine)
   ↓
Step 4: Craft Spear or Club → basic defense and hunting
   ↓
Step 5: Craft Torch → survive night, explore safely
   ↓
Step 6: Craft Axe → chop first logs → unlocks Tier 1 materials
   ↓
Step 7: Craft Pickaxe → mine first ores/stone → expands into Tier 1 minerals
