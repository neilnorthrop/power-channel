# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Seeding Roadmap & Options (ideas for later)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This section outlines potential enhancements to evolve this file into a
# robust, auditable, and scalable content management pipeline for reference
# data. These are suggestions only â€” not enabled by default.
#
# 1) Externalize seed data (YAML/JSON/CSV)
#    - Store content under db/data/, e.g.:
#      db/data/actions.yml
#      db/data/resources.yml
#      db/data/skills.yml
#      db/data/items.yml
#      db/data/buildings.yml
#      db/data/recipes.yml
#    - Example (db/data/resources.yml):
#        - name: Gold Coins
#          description: The currency of the realm.
#          base_amount: 10
#          drop_chance: 1.0
#          action: Taxes
#        - name: Wood
#          description: A common building material.
#          base_amount: 5
#          drop_chance: 1.0
#          action: Chop Wood
#    - Loader pattern:
#        YAML.safe_load_file(path, aliases: true)
#        Validate keys; resolve references by name (e.g., action: "Taxes").
#    - Pros: non-code content updates; clearer reviews/diffs; easier content ops.
#    - Consider JSON Schema or dry-schema for validating shape before apply.
#    - Support ERB in YAML for small computed fields or environment-specific values.
#    - Allow per-environment overlays, e.g. db/data/production/*.yml overrides.
#
# 2) Strong uniqueness + bulk upserts
#    - Add unique indexes and model validations on natural keys (typically `name`).
#      Example migration:
#        add_index :resources, :name, unique: true
#        add_index :actions,   :name, unique: true
#    - Use ActiveRecord#upsert_all for bulk efficiency:
#        Model.upsert_all(rows, unique_by: :index_resources_on_name)
#      Note: requires unique index and careful column selection.
#    - For join tables (e.g., RecipeResource), consider composite unique indexes
#      (recipe_id, resource_id) to prevent dupes.
#
# 3) Safety and idempotency features
#    - Dry-run mode via ENV["SEEDS_DRY_RUN"], printing a diff of planned changes
#      without writing. Implement by comparing current attributes vs incoming rows.
#    - Change summary after run: created/updated/skipped counts per model.
#    - Guard against destructive operations by default; require ENV flags to
#      enable deletes of now-absent rows ("prune mode").
#    - Wrap in a transaction per model group for atomicity; optionally chunk for
#      very large datasets.
#
# 4) Environment-specific behavior
#    - Extensions for dev/test: generate demo users, fake inventories, etc.,
#      behind ENV flags. Keep production seeds strictly definition-only.
#    - Example flags: SEEDS_DEMO=1, SEEDS_VERBOSE=1.
#
# 5) Versioning and change detection
#    - Embed a version number or content hash in each data file (e.g. `_version`),
#      save last-applied version in a `seed_runs` table to track deployments.
#    - Compute a digest (e.g., SHA256) of the data payload; skip apply when
#      unchanged; record a SeedRun row: who, when, versions, summary.
#
# 6) Declarative relationships
#    - Keep references in data by natural keys (e.g., names), resolving to IDs
#      during load. Provide helpful errors if dependencies are missing.
#    - Optionally annotate rows with stable external IDs (slugs) for resilience
#      across renames (e.g., `slug: taxes`), and treat `name` as display-only.
#
# 7) Data migrations vs seeds
#    - Use Rails migrations for structural changes (columns/indexes) and one-off
#      data migrations that alter historical records.
#    - Reserve seeds for current, canonical reference definitions and recipes.
#    - For renames (like "Gold" -> "Gold Coins"), prefer explicit data migration
#      files over ad hoc seed code when it affects historical data.
#
# 8) CI integration
#    - Run `db:seed` as part of CI setup to catch validation issues early.
#    - Add a lint task (e.g., `seeds:lint`) to validate external data files and
#      reference integrity without touching the DB.
#
# 9) Performance tips
#    - Batch operations per model with `upsert_all` or import gems when volume
#      grows. Avoid N+1 by prefetching referenced records into hashes keyed by
#      natural keys.
#    - Temporarily disable callbacks on models that do heavy work when seeding.
#
# 10) Multi-tenant considerations
#    - If you add tenants, factor seeds per tenant (e.g., `tenant: default`) or
#      run seeds in the context of each tenant schema.
#
# 11) Rollback and auditability
#    - Snapshot pre-seed state for reference models (e.g., to JSON) when
#      SEEDS_BACKUP=1 is set, so you can inspect prior values.
#    - Maintain a `seed_runs` table logging runs, operator, env, versions, and
#      a JSON summary of changes.
#
# 12) Developer ergonomics
#    - Rake tasks to streamline workflows:
#        rails seeds:apply                    # load reference data
#        rails seeds:dry_run                  # compute and print diffs only
#        rails seeds:lint                     # validate external files
#        rails seeds:dump[model]              # dump current DB rows to YAML
#        rails seeds:prune                    # remove rows not in files (guarded)
#    - Add `bin/seeds` wrapper to pass flags conveniently.
#
# 13) Internationalization (I18n)
#    - Store translations for names/descriptions alongside base records or in
#      dedicated locale files. Optionally seed translation tables (e.g., Model::I18n).
#
# 14) Security & governance
#    - Keep seed files free of secrets. Optional signing of data bundles if you
#      plan to accept external contributions. Validate inputs carefully.
#
# These are ideas to consider incrementally. The current implementation remains
# code-first, idempotent, and user-safe. When ready, we can factor the loader
# and add one feature at a time without disrupting existing behavior.
